To use, in the device click, show devices, then open the console, next to the name of each serial connection on your computer there will be a letter from a-z, select the letter corresponding to the rs232 adapter you are using to talk to the PTZ camera, select baud rate, then click connect button. Check the console window that poped up earlier to see if there was an error connecting.
